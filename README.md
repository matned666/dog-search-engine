#SEARCH ENGINE 

This is my first training try with an own hibernate program. 

This is a simple JFrame with search engine, connected with
database.
First you can choose your table, than you can guuugle your records :-)

JFrame -> Model Contract View pattern common in Android 

You can search them by name regex, age, weight, 
owner name , etc.

A simple database sql file is in resources folder.
It is with a table creation and 1000 records (dog.sql).

Hibernate.cfg.xml file is also in resources, but you'd have to 
check it in my first commit.
You have to add your database name, host, and user with 
privileges, of course password and mapping class to entities.
